# Blogging-app
This is a backend project based on blog app.

This project is made from a spring boot framework, which is a popular java framework.
All the CRUD functionality is implemented for user, post, post_category, comment.
I have also implemented the Authentication and Authorization in this app.
For Authorization JWT token is implemented in this app.

There is a url (/swagger-ui/index.html) which can be used to get all the information about the api's of blogging app.
